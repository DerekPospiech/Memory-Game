# Memory Game

Project Overview
------------

This is an older Udacity project with the goal of mastering grid. I was provided the basic static page from: https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

According to the instructions provided by Udacity:

"The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file."

Project Main Challenges
------------

* create flip functionality for cards
* create a timer for the game
* create a reset function that resets the score and time
* create a matching function that changes the cards color when match is found
* create a scoring system based on how many tries it takes to clear the whole board

Install
--------
This github holds all files necessary to run the index.html. 

Contributing
------------
Udacity provided the static page. Derek Pospiech created the javascript and interactive functionality.

Issues?
------------
* There is currently a logic issue with the scoekeeping system. It does not accuretly record the score and gives a different score than the one displayed.
